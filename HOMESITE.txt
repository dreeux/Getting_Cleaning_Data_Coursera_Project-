
Using an anonymized database of information on customer and sales activity, including 

property and coverage information, Homesite is challenging you to predict which customers 

will purchase a given quote. 


metric - AUC


Modelling approaches - Homesite


Used Leaderboard feedback for validation

(Using LB as feedback is obviously not the right way to go about for validation, 

should use either CV or holdout set each model iteration run was taking 8-10 hours, cv 

requires better hardware config (was running on a dual core), using a hold out means one 

had to retrain the model twice , This is a one off case, I have upgraded my local machine,

running i5 now. Should not be a problem in the next competitions)



Feature Engineering / preprocessing


I did try a whole lot of approaches , I'll mention the approaches which worked


removed features with zero variance and non zero variance

used LabelEncoder to convert character features into numeric

In the dataset missing values were encoded as -1 by the organisers, there were two 

columns which still had missing values ( All categorical) , tried different imputation 

methods none of which translated to a LB increase , went with -1


From the date field created extra vars such as month, year, day, week, dates with different 

formats (((tmp$year * 52 ) + tmp$week) %% 4)


one hot encoding for categoricals and date features

( tried different categorical variable thresholds for dummy variable creation )


row wise count of NA's, zeros


used feature importance and corelation to target to select features to be used for 

creating interaction features. Got the biggest LB jump by trying this.


tried only 2 way feature interaction

In forums top solutions used 2, 3, 4 way interactions 


Switched to the prudential challenge midway , On the last week tried building the base 

models and ensembling but there was a bug in the ensemble code which I was able to fix 
only after the competition got over which affected things. 



DATA AVAILABLE and NUANCES

train dataset had around 260K rows , test dataset had around 174K rows with 298 features

response is binary and with 0 and 1 being the two classes. 81 % of values in response are 

0's and the remaining 19% are 1's.

Features are mainly divided into 5 categories.

    Coverage Fields
    Sales Fields
    Property Fields
    Personal Fields
    Geographic Fields

Other than a Date feature ( Original_Quote_Date) and a continuous feature ( Sales Field8) , 
remaining  are Categorical features.
